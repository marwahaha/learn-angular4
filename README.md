# Learn Angular 4
> **learn-angular4** is a simple repository to keep my study files while I keep learning...

Init a new project with `angular-cli`, you can run:
```shell
$ ng new appName
```

To run your app, access created directory and run:
```shell
$ cd appName
$ ng server
```

#### Components

To generate your components, you need to run `ng generate component componentName` or abreviate command `ng g c componentName`.

if you are not using _tests_, you can omit this to create a spec file to our component, using this flag `--spec=false`.
